##Topic:
We have been working from home for more than six months because of the pandemic. In my time alone, the one thing I think about the most is: What to eat today? I want to record the changes in taste that I experience every day because the taste is a very subjective and abstract thing. I hope to show my daily diet including my feeling through specific colors and different charts
Data: from Aug 31st to Sept 8th, ten days of daily meal including the flavors, food, meal, and duration of each meal
##Desigin：
Sketch
Personal data tracking, so I choose this kinda kid-ish font 
Listed some interesting findings here
##Programming:
Part 1: Chord diagram represent the flow of flavor：
Why I want to track five flavors?
We have been working from home for more than six months because of the pandemic. In my time alone, the one thing I think about the most is: What to eat today? I want to record the changes in taste that I experience every day, because taste is a very subjective and abstract thing. I hope to show my daily diet including my feeling through specific colors and multiple diagrams.

How to read this chord diagram?
-Hover over each flavor, check how long the relevant taste stays
-Hover over each node (connecting lines inbetween), check the blending of flavors
-The flavor flow has a direction, from A to B means: first feel flavor A, then feel flavorB
What's so interesting?
Tracked for altogether 10 days from Aug.31st to Sept.8th
Always skip breakfast because of class (ಥ﹏ಥ)
Love sour flavor blended w/ spicy flavor

Part 2: grouped bar chart
What did I eat everyday?
This group bar chart shows a more detailed daily diet. I want to use this to know what food I eat every day, and what food preferences I have not noticed


How to read this grouped barchart diagram?
-X axies represent the duration of each meal
-Y axies node listed each meal throughout the past ten days
-Hover over each bar to see the specific food of each meal. Here color blended in a linear gradient format represent the changes of flavor from my perspective
What's so interesting?
Had a lot of instant food
Most of the time, finished my meal within 30 mins
Love hot pot (*´∇｀*)
